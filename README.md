Geotools 2
==========

About
-----

This is a MeteorJS wrapper for the Geotools 2 package. Here's the preamble from the library:

> GeoTools is a set of javascript classes for performing conversions between WGS84 latitude and longitude coordinates, and Ordnance Survey Great Britain grid references and/or Ireland National Grid. It has similar performance to the conversion carried out by a typical GPS receiver, and is accurate to approximately 7m for 90% of Great Britain

Version
-------

This is version `1.0.0` of the package and `version 2` of the underlying library. It's unlikely to change, ever - the original was cast in 2005.
